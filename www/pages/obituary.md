A memorial service was held at the First United Methodist Church of San Diego on Saturday, 2 November, 2013 for John Kellogg Meyer, who died on 11 October at the age of 90. John was born in Quincy Illinois on 24 July 1923 to Katherine and Rudolf Meyer, owners of “The Model” men’s clothing store. After graduating from high school, John attended Oberlin College, majoring in psychology. After a stint in the Army in WWII, John obtained a Ph.D. in psychology from Purdue University. He worked for the U.S. Civil Service, Air Force, and Navy, until the late 1970’s in personnel research and training methods.

In January, 1949, John married Donna Jean Stember in the farming town of Ozawkie Kansas, in a ceremony that received international attention because Donna’s younger two sisters were also married in the ceremony. The three couples remained close for their entire lives, eventually sharing both 50th and 60th anniversary events. John and Donna had two children, Paula Rae and Damon Lawrence. The family moved from San Antonio, Texas to San Diego, California in 1959, and established the family home there on Point Loma.

John’s life was devoted to science and education. He was particularly fascinated with creativity, and he studied individual creativity and creativity generated through group dynamics. He was extremely well read, and had a working familiarity with the major western philosophers. John was very proud that both of his children obtained Ph.D.’s in scientific fields. He maintained a life-long interest in music, focused on playing piano, and singing choral music. His favorite composers were Brahms and Bach. His other lifelong interest was in airplanes. He was too light to fly military planes in WWII, and never obtained a pilot’s license, but volunteered for 30 years at the San Diego Aerospace Museum in restoration, curation, as a docent, and in a library function.

While unconventional, John was a highly effective parent, and was dedicated to his family. He is survived by his daughter and son and two grandchildren.
